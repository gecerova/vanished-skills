            <h2>About Our Virtual Mini-Museum</h2>
            <p>Welcome to our virtual mini-museum! This project showcases a curated selection of historical ceramic artifacts from the Ottoman Empire. Each piece reflects the rich artistic heritage, craftsmanship, and cultural layers that developed between the 14th and early 20th centuries.</p>
            <p>The Ottoman Empire was a vast and diverse society where craftsmanship held a central place in both economic production and cultural expression. Many of these traditional crafts were passed down through generations via master-apprentice relationships (usta-Ã§Ä±rak iliÅŸkisi) and were often organized within the guild system (lonca teÅŸkilatÄ±). These crafts not only fulfilled practical needs but also served as markers of social identity, aesthetic refinement, and spiritual devotion.</p>
            <p>Our aim is to offer an accessible and informative glimpse into the traditions of the Ottoman world. The selected items vary in origin, function, and style â€” from architectural tiles to household pottery â€” yet all reveal the empireâ€™s unique aesthetic and cultural identity. Explore the collection below and discover how Ottoman culture served not only as a source of glory but also became a lasting symbol of beauty, power, and tradition.</p>

            <h3>Nurcan GeÃ§er</h3>
            <p>Iâ€™m Nurcan GeÃ§er. With an interdisciplinary background in sociology and psychology, I am passionately committed to researching collective memory, cultural production, and lost traditions. After completing my undergraduate degree at Istanbul Bilgi University, I am currently pursuing a master's degree in Middle Eastern Studies at Freie UniversitÃ¤t Berlin.<br>
            The Vanished Skills project brings together both my academic interests and my connection to the field. My goal is to trace the labor practices that have not been carried over from the Ottoman era to the present day, drawing attention to cultural memory, community heritage, and local modes of production.<br>

            <h3>Ozan Usta</h3>
            <p>Iâ€™m Ozan Usta, a historian with a background in history and art history from Istanbul University. Currently, Iâ€™m pursuing a masterâ€™s degree in Interdisciplinary Studies of the Middle East at Freie UniversitÃ¤t Berlin. My academic work centers on modern Middle Eastern history, historiography, and the politics of heritage.<br>
            In the Vanished Skills project, I focus on how traditional labor practices reflect broader social and political transformations. My aim is to critically examine how certain skills are preserved, adapted, or abandoned in response to shifts in power, economy, and ideology.<br>

            <h3>Burak Can Kaya</h3>
            <p>Iâ€™m Burak Can Kaya, a political science graduate from Hacettepe University with professional experience in humanitarian organizations including the Turkish Red Crescent and IFRC. My work has focused on field coordination, data visualization, and reporting within emergency response contexts. I am currently pursuing my masterâ€™s degree in Interdisciplinary Studies of the Middle East at Freie UniversitÃ¤t Berlin.<br>
            The Vanished Skills project aligns with my passion for grassroots knowledge, social memory, and the intersection of craft and community resilience. I believe tracing fading traditions can offer valuable insights for sustainable practices and inclusive narratives that bridge past and present.<br>
